[00:18.43] Dear reader
[00:19.44] If it feels like a trap
[00:21.62] You're already in one
[00:27.27] Dear reader
[00:28.63] Get out your map
[00:30.83] Pick somewhere and just run
[00:35.74] Dear reader
[00:37.59] Burn all the files, desert all your past lives
[00:44.85] And if you don't recognize yourself
[00:48.99] That means you did it right
[01:02.49] 
[00:54.64] Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
[01:03.49] Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
[01:28.49] 
[01:11.77] Dear reader
[01:13.19] Bend when you can
[01:15.58] Snap when you have to
[01:20.70] Dear reader
[01:21.53] You don't have to answer
[01:24.37] Just 'cause they asked you
[01:29.56] Dear reader
[01:30.86] The greatest of luxuries is your secrets
[01:38.31] Dear reader
[01:39.44] When you aim at the devil
[01:42.22] Make sure you don't miss
[01:54.22] 
[01:47.97] Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
[01:56.81] Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
[02:21.81] 
[02:03.95] So I wander through these nights
[02:06.08] I prefer hiding in plain sight
[02:08.73] My fourth drink in my hand
[02:10.29] These desperate prayers of a cursed man
[02:29.79] 
[02:12.75] Spilling out to you for free
[02:15.46] But darling, darling, please
[02:17.31] You wouldn't take my word for it
[02:19.69] If you knew who was talking
[02:24.18] If you knew where I was walking
[02:28.69] To a house, not a home, all alone
[02:30.41] 'Cause nobody's there
[02:33.00] Where I pace in my pen and
[02:34.22] My friends found friends who care
[02:37.49] No one sees when you lose
[02:38.67] When you're playing solitaire
[02:53.17] 
[02:40.72] You should find another guiding light
[02:44.43] Guiding light
[02:46.05] But I shine so bright
[02:49.40] You should find another guiding light
[02:52.81] Guiding light
[02:55.14] But I shine so bright...
